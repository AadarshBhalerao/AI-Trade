1. SMA: Simple Moving Average. This is a commonly used technical indicator that calculates the average price of a stock over a specified period of time. For example, a 50-day SMA would calculate the average price of the stock over the past 50 days.

2. EMA: Exponential Moving Average. This is similar to the SMA, but it places greater weight on more recent prices. This means that the EMA responds more quickly to changes in the stock price than the SMA.

3. MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence. This is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

4. RSI: Relative Strength Index. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 indicating overbought conditions and readings below 30 indicating oversold conditions.

5. Bollinger Bands: This is a volatility indicator that uses a moving average and two standard deviations to create a band around the price of a stock. When the price moves outside of the band, it is considered to be a significant move.

6. PPO: Percentage Price Oscillator. This is similar to the MACD, but it uses the percentage difference between two moving averages instead of the absolute difference.

7. Candlestick: This is a charting technique that shows the price movement of a security. Each candlestick represents a specific time period, and shows the opening, closing, high, and low prices for that period.

8. OBV: On-Balance Volume. This is a momentum indicator that uses volume to predict changes in stock price. It measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days.

9. VWAP: Volume-Weighted Average Price. This is a measure of the average price a security has traded at over the course of a day, taking into account both volume and price.

10. ATR: Average True Range. This is a measure of volatility that takes into account any gaps in price between trading sessions.
